## 📝 About This Project

This website acts as an interactive resume, highlighting my path as a **System and Network Architecture Student** at **ENSEEIHT** (Toulouse).

It is designed to present:
* **My Profile:** Background seeking an 8-week internship starting June 2026.
* **Engineering Projects:** Including my work on capacitive sensor solutions and interactive prototypes (Arduino/Processing).
* **Professional Experience:** My roles as an IT Monitor, Help Desk Technician, and Bike Patrol in New Caledonia.
* **Skills:** System Administration, Network Infrastructure (Cisco/Wireshark), and Programming.
* **Mobility & Civic Engagement:** My transition from New Caledonia to France.

## 💻 Technical Implementation

This site was built entirely **from scratch** to demonstrate fundamental frontend development skills without relying on external frameworks:

* **Structure:** Semantic HTML5.
* **Design:** Custom CSS3 with responsive layout (Flexbox/Grid), variables, and animations.
* **Interactivity:** Pure JavaScript (Vanilla) for the tab-based navigation system.
