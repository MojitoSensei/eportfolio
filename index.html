            <h2 class="animated fade-in-up">About Me</h2>
            <p class="animated fade-in-up">As a second-year engineering student at Toulouse INP ENSEEIHT, specializing in Systems and Networks, I am actively seeking an 8-week internship starting in June 2026. My academic background, combined with hands-on experience as an IT monitor and help desk technician, has provided me with a solid foundation in network infrastructure, system administration, and IT support.</p>
            <p class="animated fade-in-up">I am a proactive and curious individual, passionate about technology and innovation. I enjoy tackling complex problems and am always eager to learn and develop new skills. My goal is to apply my knowledge in a dynamic professional environment and contribute effectively to an IT team. This e-portfolio outlines my journey, skills, and aspirations.</p>

            <h3 class="animated fade-in-up">My Mobility Experience: New Caledonia to France</h3>
            <p class="animated fade-in-up">My most significant mobility experience to date has been my move from New Caledonia to Toulouse, France, to attend ENSEEIHT. This transition was not just a geographical move, but also a major academic and cultural step. It required a great deal of organization, adaptability, and autonomy—skills that are essential in any professional environment.</p>
            <h3 class="animated fade-in-up">Future Mobility Goals</h3>
            <p class="animated fade-in-up">As a student admitted directly into the second year ("admis sur titre"), I am not eligible for the university's academic mobility programs. However, I am very keen to gain international experience through a professional internship.</p>
            <p class="animated fade-in-up">Having had the opportunity to visit Japan in the past, a country whose technological innovation I greatly admire, I would be particularly interested in an internship there. Such an experience would be an incredible opportunity to enhance both my technical and linguistic skills.</p>
